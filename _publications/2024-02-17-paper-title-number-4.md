Heated-air drying followed by resting (tempering) helps rice dry faster, but this study shows that these heating steps also change how rice behaves when cooked or processed, especially its thickness and firmness. The temperature, how long the rice stays hot, and even the surrounding air conditions all influence these texture and viscosity changes, sometimes quite dramatically. This means drying conditions should be chosen not just to protect yield, but also to control and even intentionally design rice quality for specific food products, including gluten-free foods..

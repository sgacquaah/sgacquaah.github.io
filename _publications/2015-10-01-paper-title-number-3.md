Most rice in the U.S. is dried using heated air, and this drying process behaves a lot like heat-based food sterilization because both follow similar scientific “rate of change” patterns. Since different dryers use different temperatures, humidity levels, and drying times—and these differences affect rice quality—this study set out to create a standard way to measure how much total heat a batch of rice experiences during drying. The research developed new values to describe how quickly rice loses moisture with heat and then combined them into a single index that shows how intense a drying process is compared to a standard reference temperature

This study looked at several popular Arkansas rice types to understand how turning brown rice into white (milled) rice changes how the rice flour behaves when cooked or used in food products. We found that milling can change important qualities—like how rice thickens, gels, and heats up—sometimes even more than natural differences between rice varieties. These findings suggest that choosing the right rice type and milling it in the best way can help food companies make better products. The results give useful guidance to rice breeders and processors on how milling affects how rice performs in real-world food applications.

Differences in heated-air drying conditions contribute to the inconsistencies in functionality that hinder the wide use of rice in end-use, gluten-free
product development. This study shows that thermal exposure (GATE) values could be useful for quantifying and comparing cumulative heat-exposure during drying
to facilitate predictions of changes in rice properties.
